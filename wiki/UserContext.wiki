#summary User Context

A context is a set of available commands. Some examples are the main menu context and the game context. 

Grouping commands by context allows commands to use identical input without overlapping. 

For example, in the context of a conversation with an NPC the input "n" might be interpreted as "no", whereas in the general game context "n" might be interpreted as "go north".

Contexts can have: 
  * A menu
  * A custom prompt
  * Commands
  * Automated "on entry" commands (e.g. print a message or menu)
  * A custom default command (i.e. when input doesn't match any known command)
