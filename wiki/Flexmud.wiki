#summary Flexmud, the flexible Java MUD server.

= Introduction =

I will create a playable mud server before I die. 


= Details =

  * Written in Java
  * Backed by a database using Hibernate for persistence
  * Multi threaded using the Executor framework in Java.
  * Utilizes Java NIO for non-blocking socket communication.
  * Interprets input based on user context. 
  * Executes operations as self-contained commands

= History = 

Flexmud came from Lulu's JMud. I took JMud apart and rebuilt it from scratch.

If you're interesting in copying or running Flexmud and need a little help, please email me.  Only two people have ever contacted me about Flexmud so there isn't much of a backlog of email. :)
