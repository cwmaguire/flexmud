Currently flexmud is a telnet application on its way to becoming a MUD.

The goal of flexmud is to be flexible. Hence the name.

It's nowhere near done, it's on its third iteration and it's 10 years old (but still actively developed!). I work on flexmud in my spare time.

I love to talk about my code so don't be bashful if you're looking for code explanations and/or justifications.

Beyond the main goal of a flexible mud I'm also interested in adding color support and a plugin to play the mud from IntelliJ IDEA.
